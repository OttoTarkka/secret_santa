# secret_santa
Just a little script for assigning secret santas.

Just give the names of your participants and decide if you want to keep the assignment a secret. Keeping the assignment secret is good if you are also one of the participants. In that case, the assigments will be save in separate files that you can then send to each participant without looking.
